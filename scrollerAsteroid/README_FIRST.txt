Use this to get up and running with SFML
----------------------------------------
1. Unzip onto the desktop
2. Change directory to \MyCppProjects\SFMLSkeleton\
3. Double click on the file with sln extension, this should cause visual studio 2022 to open. Alternatively, open VS2022 and drag the sln file onto it.
4. In VS2022, make sure you are set to "Debug" and "Win32", two drop down boxes top left in VS2022 (it might say "Release" or "x64" and this needs changing).
5. Hit the green arrow and check it compiles and runs OK, you should just see a 2D Game Sprite

If you want to make a new program
---------------------------------
1. Turn off VS2022
2. Copy the SFMLSkeleton folder
3. Rename that folder "myNewGame"
4. If you want to rename the project then it's easy, ask a tutor, it's just renaming a few files and folders
